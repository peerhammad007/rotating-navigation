            <h1>The Leftovers</h1>
            <small>Peer Hammad</small>
            <p>One of my favorite TV shows ever. Across three seasons and 28 hour-long episodes, The Leftovers explores the aftermath of an unexplained event that caused 2 percent of the world’s population to vanish into thin air. The series begins three years after that so-called Sudden Departure, which inevitably left so many of the people who remained on Earth stricken with grief, unable to move forward. By that point, much of the planet has slowly but surely pushed beyond the existential uncertainty caused by such a strange disappearance. But many, including all of the characters The Leftovers follows across its three seasons, have not moved on. And they may never be able to.

            Even if The Leftovers’s central idea is more humane — we don’t know where the missing people went, and they may still be alive — it still takes its time to live inside the pain of those left behind. The series’s characters struggle under the weight of so much pointless loss. And the uncertainty is almost worse. There is no meaning to what has happened, and human institutions founder in the face of trying to make sense of the senseless. As the show progressed deeper into its run, for me it became maybe the most optimistic show of its era because it stared into uncertainty, into darkness, and insisted that we would figure out how to make our own light if we found ourselves stranded. Those left behind were often stricken with grief, unable to move forward. The final two images of the series (and I promise these aren’t spoilers) are two characters holding hands and then doves returning to their roost — which, if you know your Noah’s Ark, is a sign that the end of the world is beginning to end.</p>
